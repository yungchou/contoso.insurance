# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

-   Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place

-   Stimulates the participant's thinking

-   Involves the participant in the learning process

## Whiteboard design session flow 

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

Outcome: Analyze your customer's needs

-   Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

-   Current customer infrastructure and architecture

-   Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

Outcome: Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

-   Determine your target customer audience

-   Determine customer's business needs to address your solution

-   Design and diagram your solution

-   Prepare to present your solution

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

Outcome: Present solution to your customer.

-   Present solution

-   Respond to customer objections

-   Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

-   Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

-   Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide

-   Become familiar with all key points and activities.

-   Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions

-   Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas

-   Make notes for later

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

-   **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing

-   **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

-   **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What is your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study

 
### Customer situation

Contoso, is a leading manufacturer, seller, distributor and servicer of parts for heating, venting and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. Their customer base includes some of the largest corporations and independent firms in the US. Contoso specializes in the datacenter space, designing computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units and contracting in the planning of hyper-scale cloud provider datacenter cooling strategies. As such, the research and development group are one of the largest business units in the company. The company's headquarters in in Cheyenne, Wyoming with a second large location in Seattle, Washington along with three smaller branch offices scatted around the United States.

Contoso would be considered by most as a classic IT shop, mainly focused on their infrastructure. Their application development department's skill set is dated, predominantly focused on client/server development. Two years ago, the company began a project to move portions of their infrastructure to Azure to gain efficiencies and eventually exit the hardware obsolescence cycle. In the process Contoso developed a standard deployment policy for new infrastructure that has been followed ever since.

Their ordering system is running in Azure on virtual machines with a SQL Server data tier. For many years Contoso's ordering process was done mainly via phone by their sales team based in one of their offices. Recently, the company has moved to an Internet-based ordering system with Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers in Azure housing the front-end application for the ordering, invoicing, and support options. Customers have complained at times of intermittent problems/errors with the website.

There have been ongoing stability issues including a critical server running out of disk space. This along with recent stability issues with the ordering system prompted Contoso to perform a business impact analysis of the application. This exercise resulted in an executive mandate for a four-hour recovery time objective (RTO) with a recovery point objective (RPO) for the data of 8 hours.

In addition to the ordering system, they have a legacy software program where the data is tightly coupled with the application. Because of the time and effort required, a re-write of this application is not planned. The application is being backed up using a disk-to-disk-to-tape approach. The legacy application is running on aging hardware and a decision must be made as to whether to purchase new hardware, re-write the application, or move it as-is to Azure.

Each of the branch offices are small enough to not require an on-site server infrastructure. These locations have connectivity to the Cheyenne headquarters through a Virtual Private Network (VPN). At times, various branch offices have experienced connectivity issues over the VPN to Cheyenne. While there is some understanding of these occurrences, there is a desire to increase the stability of the connection as growth continues.

Several years ago, under the leadership of Lewis Franklin, head of infrastructure and operations, individual departments started migrating their servers into Azure. The Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) team has deployed several Domain Controller (DC) Virtual Machines (VM) to a virtual network in the West Central US region. This region was chosen due to its proximity to the Cheyenne Headquarters. Some effort was made to follow the guidance of Microsoft on the use of Active Directory (AD) in Azure, but some configuration gaps remain.

The web application team has also deployed the Ordering application within the same West Central US region. While they do not have administrative rights for the SQL VMs that provide database services for the web application, they do have database rights and can access the databases through normal SQL toolsets.

Taking their cue from the AD and Web teams, the Database Administrators have also rolled out their SQL servers onto Azure VMs, choosing to host them in the West Central US region as well.

The Marketing department has recently been tasked with moving their server workloads into Azure by rebuilding each application. They have begun building their servers utilizing a single Azure storage account. They have around 40-50 VMs already but anticipate continued growth.

![The current storage account implementation has 40 to 50 virtual machines, with a Single Blob LRS Storage account, made up of 40 to 50 VHDs, one per VM.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image2.png "Storage Account Current Implementation")
*Figure 2 -- Contoso's Storage Account Configuration*

Contoso is connected via a Windows Server Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) VPN connection to Azure via a Site-to-Site Gateway. They are looking for options to provide redundancy for the hybrid connectivity to Azure due to recent network issues.

While the Azure deployments have served Contoso well so far, they are concerned about expanding workloads for their Seattle datacenter. Janet Lewis, business continuity team director, says, "it appears that while services have moved to the cloud, the overall paradigm has not moved from the single datacenter model we have always deployed."

Over a recent three-day holiday weekend, there was an incident with one of the ADDS Domain Controllers where the disk drive housing the AD database filled up and corrupted the database. This prompted a high-priority support call to Microsoft. While the damage was mitigated, the team was fortunate that the consequences were minimal.

Retroactively, checks were made on other Azure VM disk drives and there were several of them that were getting close to capacity due to teams not proactively monitoring their servers. Management is now calling for a proactive approach to monitoring operating system (OS) disk and data disk free space as well as other key metrics in the environment.

The Human Resources department has requested that IT move their server workloads into Azure and this process has begun. Their organization has a pre-existing policy that they create a new storage account for each VM in the subscription. They have deployed about 40-50 VMs but anticipate growth that will more than double the size of their deployment numbers.

![The current HR Department Storage Account implementation is in Microsoft Azure. Every VM is deployed into its own storage account in the same subscription.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image3.png "HR Department Storage Account Current Implementation")

Richard Wade, infrastructure lead, is researching options for making the overall Azure infrastructure more resilient; including looking at technologies to help recover from an Azure region-wide outage. He also is interested in protecting against data corruption or accidental deletion of data or VMs.

For the current ADDS implementation in Azure, the team has deployed a single domain controller in the West Central US. region. It is running on a Standard D1 instance with with Active Directory deployed on the C: drive.

![This image represents a single domain controller in the West Central US region.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image4.png "West Central US region - Single Domain Controller")

Additionally, the SQL Server VM and Web site implementation are also housed at the same region. SQL has been deployed on a single VM with multiple disks. One disk is utilized for the data; the other disk is for backup and log file storage. The underlying storage account is configured for geo replication.

They have deployed a load balancer in front of the web servers and configured a default health probe to monitor the servers in the load balanced pool. When they need scalability, they manually configure another web server and often leave it running even after the need for additional capacity has passed.

Contoso has received multiple complaints from customers at times when they have intermittently received HTTP 500 errors on the website. Upon investigation, it was discovered that a recent deployment failed on one of the servers in the farm and resulted in files not being correctly copied to this server.

![The SQL and Web Server Current Implementation diagram depicts three virtual machines behind a load balancer and availability set, and a single virtual machine for SQL server with two disks for data.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image5.png "SQL and Web Server Current Implementation")


Contoso's business critical applications include:

-   The authentication and authorization infrastructure

-   The website with its SQL data tier, supporting both employees, customers and third-party manufacturing plants and factories. Use cases include:

    -   Employees: Sales lead tracking

    -   Customers: search the catalog of inventory, order parts, schedule repairs and provide support

    -   Third-party manufacturing plants and factories: supply manufacturing schedules to Contoso

### Customer needs 

1.  The IT department is using outdated guidance on Azure and they need updated guidance on current architectural and deployment best practices

2.  They need assistance with enabling connectivity and authentication for new infrastructure that will be deployed for the Seattle office

3.  Identify the infrastructure requirements that should to be configured to provide redundancy and resiliency to the web servers and the database servers for the ordering application for scale, backup and resiliency

4.  A plan for recovery from data corruption or accidental deletion for all of the other infrastructure

5.  A functional storage policy in place for the anticipation of growth in Azure

6.  Monitoring option for issues that may arise on the servers and in Azure

### Customer objections 

1.  Cost is a huge concern for us. With looming infrastructure and server replacement costs, we want to avoid any unnecessary expenditures.

2.  The web application needs to have the ability to scale as we grow. What aspect of the cloud will allow this to be a reality?

3.  Downtime is becoming more of an issue for us due to development and production environments not being separate. We need to separate these from one another to avoid outages.

4.  Bandwidth is becoming an issue for self-hosting our application's ordering system, support website, etc. We are concerned that the cloud maybe constrained as well.

5.  We are very concerned about the disk space issue that occurred earlier with our ADDS DCs and nearly our Web Servers and Database Servers. Will this be addressed per the resiliency plan?

### Infographic for common scenarios

![An image that depicts various services in Azure Infrastructrure as a Service that could be used for the solution. Services included are: Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks, VPN Gateways, Hybrid Connectivity, Load Balancers, STorage, Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery and SQL Server Managed Backup.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image6.png "Common Scenarios")

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

**Outcome** 
Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format. 

Timeframe: 60 minutes

**Business needs**

Directions: With all participants at your table, answer the following questions and list the answers on a flip chart. 
1.  Who should you present this solution to? Who is your target customer audience? Who are the decision makers? 
2.  What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?

**Design**

Directions: With all participants at your table, respond to the following questions on a flip chart.

The desired outcome is to have authentication deployed using best practices in both the Cheyenne and the Seattle regions for current and future application migration.

For the ordering web app, redundancy and protection in case of failure is the main goal for all components of the design and the application should tolerate a failure in either region. The design should include network resiliency, as well as backup and restore methods in case of failure of the physical or VMs.

Directions: Design the solution architecture by drawing it on the board, and separately provide insight into how you will address the following requirements. Identify the steps needed to implement a proof of concept for the proposed solution(s) as well as what would need to be demonstrated to stakeholders.

*Virtual Network design in Azure*

1.  Document and diagram how you will build redundant Virtual Networks for Contoso. Address the following design points:

    -   Must allow for connectivity between two regions close to the Cheyenne and Seattle data centers

    -   Address the need for redundancy and resiliency in the site-to-site VPN connectivity from Contoso's offices to Azure

    -   How will you design the address space and subnets to support Contoso's requirements?

2.  Document what network security groups and rules should be put in place for protection. What ports would you open and why?

*Design for resiliency in Azure*

1.  What changes, if any, will be needed to provide resiliency for the AD servers? Diagram how many and where they need to be placed.

2.  How will you address the needs for resiliency and scalability with the ordering app?

3.  Consider storage account resiliency. What would best suit the needs for Contoso virtual machines? LRS, GRS, RA-GRS? Document why you chose the option you did. Should they move to Managed Disks?

4.  How would you address the needs of the legacy application, what storage tier and limitations do you have to work around? What SLA can Azure provide for this single instance VM?

5.  Provide Contoso with documentation concerning service limitations, quotas, subscription limits

6.  What would you recommend Contoso enable for monitoring their environment?


**Prepare**

Directions: With all participants at your table: 

1.  Identify any customer needs that are not addressed with the proposed solution
2.  Identify the benefits of your solution
3.  Determine how you will respond to the customer’s objections


## Step 3: Present the solution

**Outcome**
 
Present a solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 30 minutes

**Presentation** 

Directions:
1.  Pair with another table
2.  One table is the Microsoft team and the other table is the customer
3.  The Microsoft team presents their proposed solution to the customer
4.  The customer makes one of the objections from the list of objections
5.  The Microsoft team responds to the objection
6.  The customer team gives feedback to the Microsoft team 
7.  Tables switch roles and repeat Steps 2–6

##  Wrap-up 

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: Tables reconvene with the larger group to hear the facilitator/SME share the preferred solution for the case study.

   -   Have the table participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear the facilitator/SME share the following preferred solution

##  Preferred target audience

-   Lewis Franklin, Head of Infrastructure and Operations

-   Richard Wade, Infrastructure Lead

-   Tony Stark, Research and Development Group Director

-   Janet Lewis, Business Continuity Team Director

## Preferred solution

*Virtual Network design in Azure*

1. Document and diagram how you will build redundant Virtual Networks for Contoso. Address the following design points:

    -   Must allow for connectivity between two regions close to the Cheyenne and Seattle data centers

    -   Address the need for redundancy and resiliency in the site-to-site VPN connectivity from Contoso's offices to Azure

    -   How will you design the address space and subnets to support Contoso's requirements?

*Solution*

-   West Central US and West US 2 will be used due to their proximities to the Cheyenne and Seattle offices. Virtual Network Peering will be implemented for connectivity between the regions.

-   The Routing and Remote Access Servers (RRAS), should be configured using Windows Server Clustering so there is high availability on the on-premises site as well.

-   Address space and subnet design could use several combinations. Some example configurations:

    West Central US:

-   Apps: 10.0.0.0/24

-   Data: 10.0.1.0/24

-   Identity: 10.0.2.0/24

    West US 2

-   Apps: 172.16.0.0/24

-   Data: 172.16.1.0/24

-   Identity: 172.16.2.0/24

    ![This image represents a Virtual Network Configuration gateway containing details.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image7.png "Virtual Network Configuration gateway")

*Virtual Network Gateway configuration details*

-   You need to create multiple S2S VPN connections from each on-premises VPN device to Azure. When you connect multiple VPN devices from the same on-premises network to Azure, you need to create one local network gateway for each VPN device, and one connection from your Azure VPN gateway to the local network gateway.

-   The local network gateways corresponding to your VPN devices must have unique public IP addresses in the \"GatewayIpAddress\" property.

-   BGP is required for this configuration. Each local network gateway representing a VPN device must have a unique BGP peer IP address specified in the \"BgpPeerIpAddress\" property.

-   The AddressPrefix property field in each local network gateway must not overlap. You should specify the \"BgpPeerIpAddress\" in /32 CIDR format in the AddressPrefix field.

-   You should use BGP to advertise the same prefixes of the same on-premises network prefixes to your Azure VPN gateway, and the traffic will be forwarded through these tunnels simultaneously.

-   Each connection is counted against the maximum number of tunnels for your Azure VPN gateway, 10 for Basic and Standard SKUs, and 30 for HighPerformance SKU.

Resilient benefits:

   -   Providing route-based VPN gateways allows for the connection all three branch offices and the corporate office to connect via VPN. It also allows for the two regions to connect. There is even some room for growth and makes the connectivity resilient in case of some network event at the corporate office or a branch office.

   -   Configuring Highly Available VPN can be done using RRAS VPN and Azure VPN Gateways and clustering them for VPN redundancy.

2. Document what network security groups and rules should be put in place for protection. What ports would you open and why?

   Network security groups (NSG) will be used to help secure the configuration by limiting traffic flow exactly as a firewall rule does. NSGs may be applied to either individual network interfaces or to a subnet. In Contoso's case there will be a single NSG applied to each subnet.

Address Spaces:

-   On-Premises: 192.168.0.0/16 (Domain Controllers: 192.168.1.10 & 192.168.1.11)

-   West Central US: 10.0.0.0/16 (Domain Controllers: 10.0.2.4 & 10.0.2.5)

-   West US 2: 172.16.0.0/16 (Domain Controller: 172.16.2.4)

Network Security Groups for the West US 2 Virtual Network

Since Contoso has not deployed any additional infrastructure to West US 2 the only ports needed are for administration and replication of Active Directory.

Resilient benefits:

-   Network security groups provide protection and only allow the traffic defined by the rules through. This protection is a form of resiliency as well.

-   External and internal protection is designed and provided for resiliency and hardening for the environment.

*Design for resiliency in Azure*

1.  What changes, if any, will be needed to provide resiliency for the AD servers? Diagram how many and where they need to be placed.

    *AD configuration details*

    -   Active Directory Domain Service (ADDS) Domain Controllers (DC) are deployed into Azure virtual machines. These are extensions of the on-premises AD DS DCs and allow for resiliency for the authentication and authorization mechanism that Contoso employees use today.

    -  Configure multiple VMs as Domain Controllers in the West Central U.S. region and two others in the West US 2. ADDS Sites and Services will be configured with the two Azure regional virtual networks as new sites in AD.

    -   Each Domain Controller will be configured with a Data Disk for the ADDS database and will be configured to back up via Azure Backup for disaster recovery and business continuity. To avoid any issue with the ADDS DB, this data disk needs to be configured with caching set to NONE.

For details on restoring ADDS DCs see the following: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/backup-azure-restore-vms/#restoring-domain-controller-vms> and <https://technet.microsoft.com/library/virtual_active_directory_domain_controller_virtualization_hyperv(v=ws.10).aspx#backup_and_restore_considerations_for_virtualized_domain_controllers>

Resilient benefits:

-   Storing the AD files on a data disk with caching set to None will keep the ADDS database and SYSVOL from any potential corruption due to caching

-   Adding DCs into an availability set will spread them across fault domains and update domains so that authentication and authorization servers are highly available

-   Deploying multiple DCs in multiple regions allows for redundancy in each region in the event of a regional Azure issue

-   Replication across regions also allows for disaster recovery should the need arise and faster recovery of the ADDS database

-   Removing the DC that is not in an availability set helps avoid a single point of failure for that VM

-   Using Azure Backup, even with the caveats on restoring, allows for another layer of redundancy for recovery options

2.  How will you address the needs for resiliency and scalability with the ordering app?

    *Web Server configuration details*

    The IIS Web Servers will be configured in the Apps Subnet and built on VMs. To help manage the load and provide performance options, the servers will be deployed into a Scale Set within Azure. This will allow Contoso the option to scale-up, scale-out, and even scale-down and scale-in based on the need. It will cease Contoso's practice of scaling manually as it is rife with issues and lacks the automated scaling that can be provided otherwise for resiliency.

    Contoso's use of an Availability Set for the Web farm VMs should be applauded. Availability Sets provide protection and resiliency against unplanned and planned downtime. We configured the availability set to spread the VMs across **three** fault domains and **five** update domains.

    A change of the Health Probe on the Load Balancer to use an HTTP health probe rather than a TCP probe is wise. The HTTP probe will monitor for HTTP code 200, indicating a healthy web site. If anything, other than a 200 is detected (such as the HTTP 500 the customers experienced), then that server will be removed from the rotation until the site is deemed healthy again.

    The web tier does not need to be backed up. When a new instance of the scale set is deployed it will automatically deploy the application from a source repository.

    Resilient benefits:

    -   Moving the Health Probe from TCP to HTTP on the load balancer gives a deeper more application centric view into the web server health. It will help avoid any intermittent problems that customers experienced in the past.

    -   Providing Scale Sets for the Web farm deployment allows for configurable scaling (up and down) based on Contoso's desires. It allows for this to occur automatically without manual intervention and will help with the issue of deploying manually and then typically not remembering to remove the extra servers when they are no longer needed.

    -   Scale Sets are automatically deployed into availability sets so the servers as they scale will be spread across update and fault domains via the Azure fabric

    *SQL Always-On configuration details*

    SQL Server is critical to the availability of the applications at Contoso. SQL will be implemented using a total of three Servers configured using Always-On Availability Groups. The two servers in West Central US comprise a single primary and a secondary, synchronously replica of the database. The two SQL servers will be deployed into an Azure availability set and are configured behind an internal load balancer which will allow client machines to connect to the listener which will direct traffic to the machines that is designated as the primary replica machine.

    The SQL Servers will use premium managed disks with a database and log files on separate disks. The TempDB will be housed on the local host SSD drive and split to match the number of cores in the VM.

    SQL Servers will have three drive letters: C:\\, F:\\ and G:\\

    Drive   Type        Purpose
    ------- ----------- -----------------------------------------------------------
    C:\\    S10         OS
    D:\\    Local SSD   TempDB broken into multiple files (match number of cores)
    F:\\    P20         SQL Database Files
    G:\\    P20         SQL Database Log Files

**Note**: Never use the E:\\ drive on an Azure VM as some Azure Regions have Host machines that contain DVD Drives.

SQL Server Managed Backup to Microsoft Azure manages and automates SQL Server backups to Microsoft Azure Blob storage. You can choose to allow SQL Server to determine the backup schedule based on the transaction workload of your database. Or, you can use advanced options to define a schedule. The retention settings determine how long the backups are stored in Azure Blob storage. SQL Server Managed Backup to Microsoft Azure supports point in time restore for the retention time period specified.

3.  Consider storage account resiliency. What would best suit the needs for Contoso virtual machines? LRS, GRS, RA-GRS? Document why you chose the option you did. Should they move to Managed Disks?

    *Storage account configuration details*

    Moving beyond using only one storage account is a must for Contoso. The sub-optimal storage configurations at Contoso, such as 40 disks in a single storage account, or creating a single storage account per VM disk, are solved using managed disks. Managed disks remove the scalability limits associated with storage accounts, leaving the number of disks per subscription as the only remaining scale consideration.

    Managed disks only are available with the LRS resiliency option; however, the lack of platform replication is mitigated:

    -   Second region deployed with the same workloads

    -   Utilizing application-level replication (AD and SQL)

    -   Azure Backups of IaaS VMs, SQL and System State data

    Resilient benefits:

    -   Using managed storage takes the guess work out of VM storage. There is no longer a need to worry about the number of storage accounts or how many VMs use each storage account. Azure does all of this for Contoso.

    -   Managed storage honors availability sets, so this ensures that VMs in an Availability Sets will not have their storage backend fail for multiple VMs at the same time. Prior to managed disks VMs in an availability set could still have shared a storage stamp in Azure. This meant it was possible to lose the VMs in an availability set due to a storage outage if it was isolated to one stamp. With the honoring of availability sets this is no longer an issue.

    ![The Preferred Storage Approach includes three sets of Premium Managed Disks. The first set of Premium Managed Disks includes a Domain Controller, OS on Drive C, and Database/Logs on drive F. The second set of Premium Managed Disks has a Web VM Scale Set, and the OS on drive C. Data disks are optional. The third set of Premium Managed Disks includes a Legacy App, the OS on drive C, and App Files on drive F. The last set of Premium Managed Disks has SQL Servers, the OS on drive C, Databases on drive F, and Logs on drive G. Storage considerations are also listed: With Premium Pay for size provisioned; LRS Only; Mix Standard and Premium where possible; and Single instance VM use Premium for all disks to ensure 99.9% SLA.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image10.png "Preferred Storage Approach")

4.  How would you address the needs of the legacy application, what storage tier and limitations do you have to work around? What SLA can Azure provide for this single instance VM?

    *Legacy Application*

    The existing legacy application cannot be moved into an availability sets as it is based on only one VM. As a result, the best way to ensure its availability is to run it with premium storage. Azure introduced single instance SLA's for VM's, so moving this application across to Azure would now result in a 99.9 percent SLA. As the existing hardware on which it is deployed on site is aging, moving this application would benefit from reduced hardware expenditure through a refresh.

    The application will eventually require a re-write to take advantage of the advanced features available in Azure. This could be done once the application was in Azure.

    To be able to achieve the SLA provided in Azure, the disks used for the VM must be premium storage disks. There is a limitation on Azure premium storage accounts such that they only support LRS. As such a mechanism to copy the blob across to another region needs to be setup. A backup of the VM will also need to be scheduled.

    Resilient benefits:

    -   Single instance VM now supported with a 99.9 percent SLA

    -   Premium storage account must be used and replicated across to another storage account

5.  Provide Contoso with documentation concerning service limitations, quotas, subscription limits

    Contoso should be educated on the key subscription limits that they may encounter, but also be aware of how to find the documentation for these limits because they change often.

    The documentation can be found here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits>.

6.  What would you recommend Contoso enable for monitoring their environment?

    *Monitoring configuration details*

    There are several features that should be enabled using Azure Monitor:

    **Azure Alerts**

    Azure alerts also provide a unified view to all your alert rules and ability to manage them a single place; including viewing any unresolved alerts. Learn more about functionality from??[Azure alerts - Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-unified-alerts).

    Alert uses the term??**Log Alerts**??to describe alerts where signal is custom query based on??[Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-tutorial-viewdata)??or??[Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-analytics). The??[new metric alert capability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-near-real-time-metric-alerts)??provides ability to alert on??[multidimensional metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-metric-charts)??for specific Azure resources. The alerts for such resource can use additional filters on dimensions creating??**Multi-Dimensional Metric Alerts**.

    Contoso could use Azure Alerts to raise awareness to Contoso staff when an issue occurs such as the VM being restarted, deleted, or any other action they want to be made aware of.

    **Log Analytics**

    Log Analytics plays a central role in Azure management by collecting telemetry and other data from a variety of sources and providing a query language and analytics engine that gives you insights into the operation of your applications and resources. You can either interact directly with Log Analytics data through log searches and views, or you may use analysis tools in other Azure services that store their data in Log Analytics such as Application Insights or Azure Security Center.

    In Contoso's situation, they would use Log Analytics to monitor the state of the servers such as the issue mentioned about the Active Directory Domain Controller running out of disk space. A query could be made based on the % Free Space performance counter and an alert raised based on the percentage available.

    **Azure Network Watcher and Azure Automation**

    To monitor the status of their VPN Gateway and other network health Contoso should enable Azure Network Watcher. Network watcher can monitor the status of their VPN Gateway, and an Azure Automation runbook could be scheduled to check the status and report on issues.

## Checklist of preferred objection handling

1.  Cost is a huge concern for us. With looming infrastructure and server replacement costs, we want to avoid any unnecessary expenditures.

    **Potential answer**
    
    Contoso can restructure the way IT budgets are spent and ultimately save funds by rolling out the infrastructure into Azure as opposed to rolling out the infrastructure in the Cheyenne office. By, building out the infrastructure in Azure there is no upfront capital investment. The cost moves to an operating expense in a pay only for what you need and use model. This frees up Contoso's capital for other investments which are more strategic to the growth of the company. This is also done in a more professional way in that Azure datacenters are world-class, enterprise-level datacenters providing a server environment that Contoso could never build on their own. Also, deploying VMs in Azure provides resiliency at a lower cost than physical hardware.

    Also, consider that the cost of downtime might far outweigh the cost of the resiliency being built into the environment.

2.  The web application needs to have the ability to scale as we grow. What aspect of the cloud will allow this to be a reality?

    **Potential answer**
    
    Scale sets is a great choice to provide scaling of the web application. In the future, as the organization continues to grow, Azure Web Apps may also be an option. This would allow for websites to scaled in many ways without the burden of managing VMs.

3.  Downtime is becoming more of an issue for us due to development and production environments not being separate. We need to separate these from one another to avoid outages.

    **Potential answer**
    
    Azure allows for several ways to mirror a production environment and use it for development and testing. Backing up the infrastructure and restoring it to Azure is one way. Another way would be Azure Site Recovery (ASR). ASR can replicate VMs and physical machines to Azure to mirror the production environment, however at this time ASR does not support VM Scale Sets. If cross region redundancy is a requirement, VMs would be a better choice.

4.  Bandwidth is becoming an issue for self-hosting our application's ordering system, support website, etc. We are concerned that the cloud maybe constrained as well.

    **Potential answer**
    
    Azure utilizes one of the largest worldwide networks and Microsoft has invested billions of dollars for the infrastructure and connectivity to be world-class. Should there be performance issues, the applications can be scaled to address the needs of the business. There are resizing options and VM instances that address network performance options as well.

5.  We are very concerned about the disk space issue that occurred earlier with our ADDS DCs and nearly our Web Servers and Database Servers. Will this be addressed per the resiliency plan?

    **Potential answer**
    
    Azure has built-in monitoring capabilities that will address the issue of an outage. Availability sets spread the IaaS VMs across multiple racks for fault protection. Azure Alerts can provide you with emails and even scripts that can be automated when the alert occurs to take recovery actions. There is also monitoring that can be configured to monitor the health of the storage accounts and provide reporting on this.

## Customer quote (to be read back to the attendees at the end)

"By using Azure, we can build out resiliency for all aspects of our environment. It allows for infrastructure, networking, web applications, AD, and other items to be redundant and highly available. With some planning and deployment of resilient resources, I envision our LOB apps and websites will no longer be impacted by outages."

---Lewis Franklin, head of infrastructure and enterprise operations, Contoso
